Project Topic: Handwritten Digit recognition
Project Aim:
Main goal of project will be detecting and recognising handwritten text from digital
data. According to my research the most improved system have more than %99
percent success rate in recognition. Because of my limited time my aim will be
having more than %70 percent success rate. I will use machine learning techniques to
improve my algorithm and python language to develop it.
I will try to build a simple neural network system than train it for handwritten digit
recognition. Python language has specific libraries for this task and my main is
including them into my work in proper way.
Time Schedule:
04.112019 – 15.11.2019: Between this timeline I will collect data and learn necessary
things about my system which I am about to develop. This reading and
documentation will also help me to examine similar works about my topic.
15.112019 – 24.11.2019: In this time slot I will write my midterm report and
meanwhile I will begin to coding my system. I have already decided to do my coding
in python environment so there will be no waste of time for this process.
24.11.2019-02.01.2019: This last slot will be mainly about coding. If I will be able to
build my system in proper time it will also give me chance to improve my system and
reach my success aim. Moreover I will write my final report and make necessary
arrangements for my final presentation.
